============================C++ SDK===========================================
The file "pteidlib.lib" and respective header file "eidlib.h" contains the Portuguese eID C++ SDK 
hence should be loaded when developing applications that access the Portuguese Identity Card  

The file "eidlibcompat.h" contains the retrocompatibility API
and should not be used for developing new applications.
